# MetaGOflow-Sequence-Data-RO-Crate

*** THIS RO Crate now seems obsolete as we can upload the *_merged_* sequence
data files directly to MGnify - the assembled contigs will go in the Data
Products RO***

This RO-Crate contains the Quality-Controlled sequence data, the assembled contigs from the MegaHit workflow assembly step, and their associated metadata from a single run of the MetaGOflow workflow.
